Dear [HR/Manager’s Name] / Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for the abrupt manner in which I left Tekskills without serving the required notice period. I acknowledge that my sudden departure may have caused inconvenience to the team and the organization, and I deeply regret the disruption it may have created. At that time, I was dealing with unavoidable family issues which impacted my ability to follow the proper exit process.

Due to certain personal circumstances at the time, I was unable to complete the standard process in the manner I would have preferred. I sincerely appreciate your continued understanding and support in helping me regularize this now.

I kindly request your assistance with the following:

Relieving Letter – A formal confirmation of my employment period (from 11/05/2020 to 30/08/2020) will greatly help me in my career progression, as most employers require this document for verification and compliance purposes.

Correction of LWD in EPFO Portal – My actual Last Working Day was 30/08/2020. I request your support in updating the same for consistency across official records.

I am genuinely grateful for the opportunities I had at Tekskills and for the professional experience gained during my tenure. It has been valuable in shaping my career journey.

If there are any formalities or compliance steps required from my side to facilitate the above, please let me know, and I will be glad to provide them promptly.

Thank you very much for your time and cooperation. I look forward to your kind support and guidance in this matter.

Warm regards,
Manjeet Mohanty
